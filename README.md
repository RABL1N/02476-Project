# mlops_project

### Overall goal of the project

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can classify chest X ray images as either normal or showing signs of pneumonia. The main focus is on creating a reproducible and well structured machine learning workflow rather than achieving maximum performance.

## Documentation

Full documentation is available on [GitHub Pages](https://RABL1N.github.io/mlops_project).

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the curriculum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked all boxes at the end of the project. The parenthesis at the end indicates what module the bullet point is related to. Please be honest in your answers, we will check the repositories and the code to verify your answers.

### Week 1

* [X] Fill out the `data.py` file such that it downloads whatever data you need and preprocesses it (if necessary) (M6)
* [X] Add a model to `model.py` and a training procedure to `train.py` and get that running (M6)
* [X] Remember to fill out the `requirements.txt` and `requirements_dev.txt` file with whatever dependencies that you
  are using (M2+M6)

* [X] Setup version control for your data or part of your data (M8)
* [X] Add command line interfaces and project commands to your code where it makes sense (M9)
* [X] Construct one or multiple docker files for your code (M10)
* [X] Build the docker files locally and make sure they work as intended (M10)
* [X] Write one or multiple configurations files for your experiments (M11)
* [X] Used Hydra to load the configurations and manage your hyperparameters (M11)
* [ ] Use profiling to optimize your code (M12)
* [X] Use logging to log important events in your code (M14)
* [X] Use Weights & Biases to log training progress and other important metrics/artifacts in your code (M14)
* [ ] Consider running a hyperparameter optimization sweep (M14)
* [ ] Use PyTorch-lightning (if applicable) to reduce the amount of boilerplate in your code (M15)

### Week 2

* [X] Write unit tests related to the data part of your code (M16)
* [X] Write unit tests related to model construction and or model training (M16)
* [X] Calculate the code coverage (M16)
* [X] Get some continuous integration running on the GitHub repository (M17)

* [X] Add a linting step to your continuous integration (M17)
* [X] Add pre-commit hooks to your version control setup (M18)
* [X] Add a continues workflow that triggers when data changes (M19)
* [X] Add a continues workflow that triggers when changes to the model registry is made (M19)
* [X] Create a data storage in GCP Bucket for your data and link this with your data version control setup (M21)
* [ ] Create a trigger workflow for automatically building your docker images (M21)
* [X] Get your model training in GCP using either the Engine or Vertex AI (M21)
* [X] Create a FastAPI application that can do inference using your model (M22)
* [X] Deploy your model in GCP using either Functions or Run as the backend (M23)
* [X] Write API tests for your application and setup continues integration for these (M24)
* [X] Load test your application (M24)
* [ ] Create a more specialized ML-deployment API using either ONNX or BentoML, or both (M25)
* [X] Create a frontend for your API (M26)

### Week 3

* [ ] Check how robust your model is towards data drifting (M27)
* [ ] Deploy to the cloud a drift detection API (M27)
* [ ] Instrument your API with a couple of system metrics (M28)
* [X] Setup cloud monitoring of your instrumented application (M28)
* [X] Create one or more alert systems in GCP to alert you if your app is not behaving correctly (M28)
* [ ] If applicable, optimize the performance of your data loading using distributed data loading (M29)
* [ ] If applicable, optimize the performance of your training pipeline by using distributed training (M30)
